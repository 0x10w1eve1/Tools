# Tools

Just some scripts I wrote and/or find useful. 

### myUtils:

  * **UbuntuTweaks.sh:** automated a few basic configs/installs i like when installing a new ubuntu image, see utils readme for details.
  * **ctd2Git.sh**: convert a [CherryTree](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree) document into a linux directory of subdirectories. Could be used as a cherytree to github conversion, but i don't parse cherrytree's formatting into markup. 
  * **letsencryptApache.sh**: automated install and config of apache with a signed cert from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
